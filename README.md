# Angular 2 Base Project

## Description
This repository has the goal of making seeding an Angular 2 project easy. Currently it's in heavy development, as Angular 2 isn't released yet.

This is a repository forked from mschwarzmueller/angular2-seed, updated to RC4 and router 3.0.0-alpha.8.

We gonna try to keep this repository updated with the angular 2 development.

## Features
dev/ folder holds TypeScript (Angular 2) code => compiled into app/ folder, bundled into bundle.js (incl. dependencies). Templates (html) and Styles (css) are all copied to app/ folder too.

assets/ folder holds other assets (e.g. SCSS code) => compiled into src/ folder.

Bundling of TypeScript is managed via SystemJS Builder. Code compilation is managed via Gulp.
